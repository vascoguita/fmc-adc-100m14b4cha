    The **FmcAdc100M14b4cha** is a 4 channel 100MSPS 14 bit ADC card in FMC (FPGA Mezzanine Card) format. By default it uses
    only signals from the LPC rows of the HPC connector that is mounted. The gain can be set by software in three steps:
    +/-50mV, +/-0.5V, +/-5V. An advanced offset circuit is used in the front-end design of the ADC board, and allows a
    voltage shift in the range of +/-5V that is independent on the chosen gain range.
